# GMS
Purpose : GMS will generate an optimized schedule for employees to minimize labor costs. The program will analyze information about the team of employees and the available working shifts in order to generate an efficient working schedule. GMS will also have the ability to let users send the generated schedules to the userâ€™s employees.

This is the begininng of our group's first Software Engineering Project.
We went from version 0.0 to 3.81 finalization to align all the documentation.

On a DFD context we retrive the user's input.

We created 5 modules to migiate the main function into 
-Main Control Module
-Info Management Module
-Schedule API
-Schedule Optimization Visualizer
-Schedule Distribution

The outputs given are
-Optimized Schedule
-Distinct Employee Schedules
-Optimization Visualization

Disclaimer:
This was our first taste of working on a project as a team. I also had absolutely no knowledge of python until this project had begun since everyone coded in python.
